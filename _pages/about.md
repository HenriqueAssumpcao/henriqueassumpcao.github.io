Masters Student in Computer Science at [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/)<br>
Email: henriquesoares[at]dcc[dot]ufmg[dot]br<br>
My c.v. can be found [here](../assets/pdf/HenriqueAssumpcao_CV.pdf) (last updated in february 2025)

I'm coursing the first year of a Masters degree in Computer Science at UFMG, under the supervision of [Prof. Gabriel Coutinho](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~gabriel/) and [Prof. Csaba Schneider](https://schcs.github.io/WP/). My research focuses on combinatorial parameters of the Johnson Graphs, namely their coclique and chromatic numbers. I'm also currently working in a research project with [Inter Bank](https://inter.co/) on quantum algorithms for finance, focusing on developing novel methods for complex problems like portfolio optimization and fraud detection.

At the beginning of 2025, I finished my Bachelor's degree in computer science at UFMG. My undergraduate thesis focuses on semisimple algebras and their applications to combinatorics and optimization, with an emphasis on the Artin-Wedderburn theorems and distance-regular graphs. The original Portuguese version can be found [here](https://monografias.dcc.ufmg.br/monografia/algebras-grupos-e-grafos/), and the English version can be found [here](../assets/pdf/undergrad_thesis.pdf).

From 2023 to 2024, I completed a minor in pure mathematics and also worked as an undergraduate researcher advised by Prof. Gabriel Coutinho, focusing on algebraic and spectral graph theory.

From 2020 to 2022 I worked on multiple projects related to machine learning and data science, mainly focusing on language models and graph neural networks, under the supervision of [Prof. Fabricio Murai](https://murai.dcc.ufmg.br/). In 2021 and 2022, I worked in a research project with Inter Bank on money laundering detection, and by the end of that year I presented our findings at the IEEE BigData 2022 conference, in Osaka, Japan.

For the past years, I've also been deeply interested in learning subjects from pure mathematics, such as Abstract Algebra, Graph Theory, Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Topology and Functional Analysis. I intend to make posts related to these subjects in the [blog](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/blog/) section of this website.
