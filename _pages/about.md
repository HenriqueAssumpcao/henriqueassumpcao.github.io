Computer Scientist<br>

[C.V.](../assets/pdf/HenriqueAssumpcao_CV.pdf) (last updated in July 2025)

I'm a Machine Learning researcher at [Inter](https://inter.co/) and a Master's student in Computer Science at [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/), advised by [Prof. Gabriel Coutinho](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~gabriel/) and [Prof. Csaba Schneider](https://schcs.github.io/WP/). I'm also a member of [VEQTOR](https://www.veqtor.dcc.ufmg.br/) and [T-REX](https://trex.dcc.ufmg.br/).

My [research](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/research/) interests include machine learning and graph theory. At Inter, I work mainly on representation learning for large transaction networks, language models and recommender systems. At UFMG, I study algebraic graph theory, with an emphasis on distance-regular graphs and association schemes.

Previously, I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Gabriel Coutinho as an undergraduate researcher in spectral and algebraic graph theory. I was also extremely fortunate to work under the supervision of [Prof. Fabricio Murai](https://users.wpi.edu/~fmurai/), focusing on graph neural networks and NLP.
