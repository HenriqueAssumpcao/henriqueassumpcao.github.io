Masters Student in Computer Science at [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/)<br>
Email: henriquesoares[at]dcc[dot]ufmg[dot]br<br>
[C.V.](../assets/pdf/HenriqueAssumpcao_CV.pdf) (last updated in february 2025)

I'm coursing the first year of a Masters degree in Computer Science at UFMG, under the supervision of [Prof. Gabriel Coutinho](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~gabriel/) and [Prof. Csaba Schneider](https://schcs.github.io/WP/). My research is on combinatorial parameters of the Johnson Graphs, namely their coclique and chromatic numbers. I'm also currently working in a research project with [Inter Bank](https://inter.co/) on quantum algorithms for finance, aiming to develop new solutions for complex problems like portfolio optimization and fraud detection.

In the beginning of 2025, I finished my B.S. degree in computer science at UFMG. My undergraduate thesis focuses on semisimple algebras and their applications to combinatorics and optimization, with an emphasis on the Artin-Wedderburn theorems and distance-regular graphs. The following contain links for the original [Portuguese version](https://monografias.dcc.ufmg.br/monografia/algebras-grupos-e-grafos/) and the
[English version](../assets/pdf/undergrad_thesis.pdf).

In 2023 and 2024, I completed a minor in pure mathematics and also worked as an undergraduate researcher advised by Prof. Gabriel Coutinho, researching algebraic and spectral graph theory.

From 2020 to 2022 I worked on multiple projects related to machine learning and data science, with an emphasis on language models and graph neural networks, under the supervision of [Prof. Fabricio Murai](https://murai.dcc.ufmg.br/). During this period, I also worked in a research project with Inter Bank on money laundering detection, and by the end of that year I presented our findings at the IEEE BigData 2022 conference, in Osaka, Japan.

For the past years, I've also been deeply interested in learning subjects from pure mathematics, such as Abstract Algebra, Graph Theory, Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Topology and Functional Analysis. I intend to make posts related to these subjects in the [blog](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/blog/) section of this website.
