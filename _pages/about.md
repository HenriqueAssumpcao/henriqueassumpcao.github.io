Masters Student in Computer Science at [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/)<br>
Email: henriquesoares[at]dcc[dot]ufmg[dot]br<br>
[C.V.](../assets/pdf/HenriqueAssumpcao_CV.pdf) (last updated in march 2025)

I'm coursing the first year of a Masters degree in Computer Science at UFMG, under the supervision of [Prof. Gabriel Coutinho](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~gabriel/) and [Prof. Csaba Schneider](https://schcs.github.io/WP/). My research is on combinatorial parameters of the Johnson Graphs, namely their coclique and chromatic numbers. I'm also currently working in a research project with [Inter Bank](https://inter.co/) on quantum algorithms for finance, aiming to develop new solutions for complex problems like portfolio optimization and fraud detection.
