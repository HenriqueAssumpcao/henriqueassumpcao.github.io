[C.V.](../assets/pdf/HenriqueAssumpcao_CV.pdf) (last updated in June 2025)

I'm currently a Machine Learning researcher at [Inter](https://inter.co/). I'm also a Masters sudent in Computer Science at [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/), under the supervision of [Prof. Gabriel Coutinho](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~gabriel/) and [Prof. Csaba Schneider](https://schcs.github.io/WP/).

My [research](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/research/) is on two main topics: machine learning and graph theory. At Inter, I work mainly on representation learning for large transaction networks, large language models and recommender systems. At UFMG, I study graph theory, currently focusing on association schemes, distance-regular graphs and semidefinite programming.
