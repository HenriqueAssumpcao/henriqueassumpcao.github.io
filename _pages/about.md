My c.v. can be found [here](../assets/pdf/HenriqueAssumpcao_CV.pdf) (last updated in january 2024)

I'm coursing my 9th semester (out of 10) in Computer Science. In 2023, I started a minor in pure mathematics, and also started to work as an undergraduate researcher under the supervision of [Prof. Gabriel Coutinho](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~gabriel/), focusing on algebraic and spectral graph theory. Currently, I'm studying semisimple algebras, self-adjoint matrix algebras, and their applications to combinatorial optimization and graph theory. 

From 2020 to 2022 I worked on multiple projects related to machine learning and data science, mainly focusing on language models and graph neural networks, under the supervision of [Prof. Fabricio Murai](https://murai.dcc.ufmg.br/). During 2021 and 2022, I worked as a research assistant in a project with [Inter Bank](https://inter.co/) on money laundering detection, and by the end of that year I presented our findings at the IEEE BigData 2022 conference, in Osaka, Japan.

Since 2023 I've been deeply interested in learning subjects from pure mathematics, such as Abstract Algebra, Graph Theory, Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Topology and Functional Analysis. I intend to post things related to such subjects in the [blog](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/blog/) section of this website.
