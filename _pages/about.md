Masters Student in Computer Science at [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/)<br>
Email: henriquesoares[at]dcc[dot]ufmg[dot]br<br>
[C.V.](../assets/pdf/HenriqueAssumpcao_CV.pdf) (last updated in march 2025)

I'm currently a Masters sudent in Computer Science at UFMG, under the supervision of [Prof. Gabriel Coutinho](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~gabriel/) and [Prof. Csaba Schneider](https://schcs.github.io/WP/).

I do [research](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/research/) on two main topics: machine learning and graph theory. At UFMG, I study algebraic graph theory, focusing on association schemes and distance-regular graphs.
