## Gauge Duality and SDP formulations for Maxcut

I presented a seminar about how to apply the theory of Gauge duality to SDP formulations of the maxcut problem, namely how to relate the linear programming formulations of the weighted maximum cut with the problem of fractional cut-cover through gauge duality, and also how to relate the famous Goemans-Williamson SDP formulation of Maxcut with its gauge dual. The slides can be found [here](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/assets/pdf/GaugeDuality_and_Maxcut.pdf)

## Quantum Random Number Generation

I wrote a seminar about Quantum Random Number Generation as the final project for the course in Quantum Computing at UFMG, the slides of the presentation (in portuguese) can be found [here](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/assets/pdf/qrng_slides.pdf), and the survey (in english) can be found [here](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/assets/pdf/qrng_survey.pdf).

## Functional Analysis and Universal Approximation

I presented two seminars on introduction to functional analysis and the universal approximation theorem for the Advanced Seminars in Mathematical Aspects of Deep Learning course at UFMG. You can find the lecture materials (in portuguese) for these topics [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AlaN2gyuSPyIgcIktM95C292D1FRuqDg).
