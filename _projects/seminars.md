## Quantum Computing: Quantum Random Number Generation

I wrote a seminar about Quantum Random Number Generation as the final project for this course, the slides of the presentation (in portuguese) can be found [here](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/assets/pdf/qrng_slides.pdf), and the survey (in english) can be found [here](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/assets/pdf/qrng_survey.pdf).

## Seminars in Mathematical Aspects of Deep Learning

My seminars were on introduction to functional analysis and the universal approximation theorem. You can find the lecture materials (in portuguese) for these topics [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AlaN2gyuSPyIgcIktM95C292D1FRuqDg).
