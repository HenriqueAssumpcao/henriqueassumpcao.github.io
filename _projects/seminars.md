## Quantum Random Number Generation

I wrote a seminar about Quantum Random Number Generation as the final project for the course in Quantum Computing at UFMG, the slides of the presentation (in portuguese) can be found [here](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/assets/pdf/qrng_slides.pdf), and the survey (in english) can be found [here](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/assets/pdf/qrng_survey.pdf).

## Functional Analysis and Universal Approximation

I presented two seminars on introduction to functional analysis and the universal approximation theorem for the Advanced Seminars in Mathematical Aspects of Deep Learning course at UFMG. You can find the lecture materials (in portuguese) for these topics [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AlaN2gyuSPyIgcIktM95C292D1FRuqDg).
