# Talks in events

## Gauge Duality and Coherent Configurations (CNMAC 2024)
I presented a poster at the XLIII National Congress on Applied and Computational Mathematics, about a recent result that me and my advisor proved. We showed that an equality involving the SDP relaxation of MAXCUT and its gauge dual, which was previously known to hold only for edge-transitive graphs, also holds for distance-regular and 1-walk-regular graphs. More generally, this equality holds for certain graphs in coherent algebras. The poster can be found [here](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/assets/pdf/CNMAC_POSTER.pdf).

## Money Laundering detection using Graph Neural Networks (IEEE BigData 2022)
I gave an oral presentation of our paper "DELATOR: Money Laundering Detection via Multi-Task Learning on
Large Transaction Graphs" at the IEEE BigData conference in Osaka, Japan. Our work is a case study that shows how to apply graph neural network models to money laundering detection on large banking networks, in partnership with the Brazilian bank Inter. The slides of the presentation can be found [here](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/assets/pdf/DELATOR_SLIDES_IEEE.pdf).


# Seminars presented at UFMG
## Distance-regular graphs and Association Schemes (2024)

I gave three lectures on the basics of distance-regular graphs, association schemes and coherent configurations. In the first lecture, I covered the basics of distance-regular graphs and Smith's theorem, in the second lecture I covered the basics of association schemes and Bigg's formula, and in the third lecture I covered coherent algebras, commutants and the group orbital scheme. These were given in a seminar class in algebraic graph theory, and the notes can be found [here](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/assets/pdf/AGT_NOTES.pdf).

## Gauge Duality and SDP formulations for Maxcut (2024)

I presented a seminar about how to apply the theory of Gauge duality to SDP formulations of the maxcut problem, namely how to relate the linear programming formulations of the weighted maximum cut with the problem of fractional cut-cover through gauge duality, and also how to relate the famous Goemans-Williamson SDP formulation of Maxcut with its gauge dual. The slides can be found [here](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/assets/pdf/GaugeDuality_and_Maxcut.pdf).

## Functional Analysis and Universal Approximation (2023)

I presented two seminars on introduction to functional analysis and the universal approximation theorem for the Advanced Seminars in Mathematical Aspects of Deep Learning course at UFMG. You can find the lecture materials (in portuguese) for these topics [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AlaN2gyuSPyIgcIktM95C292D1FRuqDg).

## Quantum Random Number Generation (2023)

I wrote a seminar about Quantum Random Number Generation as the final project for the course in Quantum Computing at UFMG, the slides of the presentation (in portuguese) can be found [here](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/assets/pdf/qrng_slides.pdf), and the survey (in english) can be found [here](https://henriqueassumpcao.github.io/assets/pdf/qrng_survey.pdf).
