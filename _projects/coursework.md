This post is essentially a non-exhaustive list of the courses related to CS and mathematics I've taken over the past few years. Introductory and intermediate courses such as Calculus, Probability, Algorithms, etc, will not be listed as they are mostly standard amongst CS programs worldwide. You can find all of the mandatory courses for the CS BSc at UFMG [here](https://ufmg.br/cursos/graduacao/2377/91205).

Courses marked with "(grad)" mean that they are graduate-level courses, whereas courses without this indication are undergraduate-level. Courses marked with "(online)" mean that I've taken them online. Courses marked with "(todo)" are ones I'm certain I will attend in the future.
